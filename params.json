","body":"### aCute is an angular-inspired web framework for the server.\r\nThe goal of the aCute framework is to help developers build big, testable, modular web apps with node.js.  The framework uses dependency injection (DI) and inversion of control (IOC) to make your application services more testable and easier to re-use.  It's based on the Angular client-side framework, but is powered on the server by express.js and brings the idea of dependency injection to views as well as services.\r\n\r\naCute is looking for developers.  If you're interested in working on the aCute framework, please fork away and create a pull request.\r\n\r\nThe application framework design will go here soon.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
