/**
 * Utilities are free-form chunks of code that cannot be injected, but rather
 * accessed anywhere in the application directly.  These do not have a set
 * API nor a set return type, but are instead used to provide access to 
 * any code that doesn't fit into any other role.
 * 
 * Utilities can be blocking or non-blocking, although blocking utilities are
 * strongly discouraged.
